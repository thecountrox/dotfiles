* About DWM
#+CAPTION: dmenu-distrotube

Dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X. Dwm is created by the good folks at [suckless.org](https://suckless.org).  This is my personal build of dwm.  I used a number of patches in this build to make dwm more "sensible" rather than "suckless."

** The patches I added to this build include:
+ alpha (for transparency)
+ attachaside (new clients appear in the stack rather than as the master)
+ cyclelayouts (cycles through the available layouts)
+ gridmode (adding a grid layout)
+ restartsig (allows dwm to be restarted with a keybinding)
+ rotatestack (moves a window through the stack, in either direction)
+ statuspadding (horizontal and vertical padding in the status bar are now configurable options)
+ uselessgap (adding gaps when more than one window)

** The dependencies for dwm-distrotube include:
+ libxft
+ ttf-hack
+ ttf-joypixels
+ st
+ dmenu
+ tabbed

Also, you will need to add the following from the AUR:
+ nerd-fonts-complete (optional)
+ https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/ (needed for colored fonts and emojis)

Also, if you are building this on an Ubuntu-based system, you need to install libx11-dev and xorg-dev.

* Installing dwm-distrotube on Arch Linux
All you need to do is download the PKGBUILD from this repository.  Then run the following command:

=makepkg -cf=

This will create a file that ends in .pkg.tar.zst (for example, dwm-distrotube-git-6.2-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst).  Then run:

=sudo pacman -U *.pkg.tar.zst=

Alternatively, you could also install dwm-distrotube-git from my own personal Arch repository.  To do so, add the following to the end of /etc/pacman.conf :

#+begin_example
[dt-arch-repo]
SigLevel = Optional DatabaseOptional
Server = https://gitlab.com/dwt1/$repo/-/raw/master/$arch
#+end_example

Then, sync the repositories and update your system with:
=sudo pacman -Syyu=

And, then:
=sudo pacman -S dwm-distrotube-git=

=NOTE:= Installing dwm-distrotube-git conflicts with the standard dwm package.  If you already have dwm installed, you will be asked if you want to remove dwm and install dwm-distrotube-git instead.

* Installing dwm-distrotube on other Linux distributions
Download the source code from this repository or use a git clone:

#+begin_example
git clone https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dwm-distrotube.git
cd dwm-distrotube
sudo make clean install
#+end_example

=NOTE:= Installing dwm-distrotube will overwrite your existing dwm installation.

* My Keybindings
The MODKEY is set to the Super key (aka the Windows key).  I try to keep the keybindings consistent with all of my window managers, but if you several of my window manager configs, there may be some discrepancies between them.

** Main keybindings

| Keybinding              | Action                                                       |

* Running dwm
If you do not use a login manager (such as lightdm) then you can add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

=exec dwm=

If you use a login manager (like lightdm), make sure that you have a file called dwm.desktop in your /usr/share/xsessions/ directory.  It should look something like this:

#+begin_example
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Dwm
Comment=Dynamic window manager
Exec=dwm
Icon=dwm
Type=XSession
#+end_example

* Configuring dwm-distrotube

If you installed dwm-distrotube-git with pacman, then the source code can be found in /opt/dwm-distrotube-git.  If you downloaded the source and built dwm-distrotube yourself, then the source is in the directory that you downloaded.  The configuration of dwm-distrotube is done by editing the config.def.h and (re)compiling the source code.

=sudo make install=
	
* Adding an autostart file
dwm-distrotube has been patched in such a way that it looks for an autostart file at: $HOME/.dwm/autostart.sh

You will need to create this file and the directory that it is located.  An example autostart.sh is included below:

#+begin_example
#! /bin/bash
picom &
nitrogen --restore &
dwmblocks &
#+end_example

The example autostart.sh above launches the compton compositor, sets the wallpaper with nitrogen and launches dwmblocks to add some widgets to our dwm panel.  Obviously, you would need to install compton and nitrogen to use those programs in your autostart.  And you would need to install [dwmblocks](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/tree/master/dwmblocks) to use it.  To use my dwmblocks, you also need to download the scripts found [here](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/tree/master/.local%2Fbin).
