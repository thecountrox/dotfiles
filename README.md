# dotfiles
My dotfiles for anyone to use


This dotfiles contains my dwm , dwmblock , dmenu and st configs.

My dwm config is heavily based on the dracula color scheme which I adore 

all of the dwm related things are patched on TOP of distrotube's dwm build
so features from his build will be seen here
