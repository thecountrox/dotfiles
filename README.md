# dotfiles
My dotfiles for anyone to use

### If you are looking for my old configs check the old branch (top left corner)
This dotfiles contains my dwm , dwmblock , dmenu and st configs.

My dwm config is heavily based on the ~~dracula~~ Catppuccin color scheme which I adore 
~~all of the dwm related things are patched on TOP of distrotube's dwm build~~
Features from his build will be seen here (+ fixes)
