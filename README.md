# dotfiles
My dotfiles for anyone to use


This dotfiles contains my dwm , dwmblock , dmenu and st configs.

My dwm config is heavily based on the dracula color scheme which I adore 

all of the dwm related things are patched on TOP of distrotube's dwm build
so features from his build will be seen here

# Installation
If u wanna use em the lazy way ,
1) copy em to /opt/ 
2) rename em like dwm-distrotube-git dwmblocks-distrotube-git st-distrotube-git dmenu-distrotube-git 
3) then cd into each one of em and run "sudo make clean install".


** might plan on making an actual install script xd**
