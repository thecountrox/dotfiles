# dotfiles
My dotfiles for anyone to use

### If you are looking for my old configs check the old branch (top left corner)
This dotfiles contains my dwm , dwmblock , dmenu and st configs.

My dwm config is heavily based on the dracula color scheme which I adore 
all of the dwm related things are patched on TOP of distrotube's dwm build
so features from his build will be seen here

link to his dwm build : https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dwm-distrotube
